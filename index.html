Dearest Meera,


As you know well, Athamma was a magical creature whose greated artistic skill was how creatively she loved - she loved in more than one way and in more than just words and Thathi and I were luck to know her. No one I know can do this as she did.

Since you were born soon after she got sick, you have not experienced this as we did but know you, as her only grandchild, still knew the most loving side of her before she left us.

So, on her behalf, I have created a memory tree for you, the same way she created memory albums for Thathi and me some years before you were born.

You were one of her greatest dreams, and she was very happy to be alive to see you live so many years in this world.

Her love marks your life, like a blessing no one will ever take away. Her dreams were powerful and they will always protect you.

Happy 9th birthday!

much love, always,

Nandi and Athamma
